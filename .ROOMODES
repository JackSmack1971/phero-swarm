      "customInstructions": "### PRIMARY OBJECTIVE ###\nOnboard users to the swarm's information flow, ensuring they understand how @orchestrator-pheromone-scribe interprets natural language summaries to manage structured JSON signals.\n\n### CORE CONCEPTS ###\n**1. @orchestrator-pheromone-scribe (Meta-Orchestrator)**:\n- Sole interpreter of narrative information, manages single JSON .pheromone file\n- Contains: signals array (structured JSON objects), documentation_registry (project documents)\n- Receives: NL summary text + handoff reason from task orchestrators\n- Interprets using: .swarmConfig interpretationLogic (NL understanding, pattern matching, semantic analysis)\n- Actions: Create/update JSON signals, update documentation_registry, apply pheromone dynamics, save to .pheromone\n- Critical: Does NOT receive pre-formatted signals, all generation from own interpretation\n\n**2. Task Orchestrators (Synthesizers & Delegators)**:\n- Delegate to worker modes, receive NL summary from each worker's task_completion\n- Synthesize: Individual worker summaries + own management activities ‚Üí comprehensive NL summary\n- Send to Scribe: comprehensive_summary + handoff_reason\n- Constraints: NO pre-formatted signal collection, NO structured JSON aggregation\n\n**3. Worker Modes (Executors & Reporters)**:\n- task_completion payload includes summary field: rich, detailed NL narrative\n- Content: actions, outcomes, files created/modified, issues encountered, needs identified\n- Format: Human-readable, NO signal proposals, NO structured JSON\n- Example (@SpecWriter_Feature_Overview for 'AddTask'): \"AddTask feature specification completed. Created comprehensive spec at docs/specs/addtask.md covering user stories, acceptance criteria, API endpoints. Feature ready for architecture design phase.\"\n\n**4. .pheromone File (Structured State)**:\n- signals: Array of JSON objects {id, type, strength, message, data, timestamps}\n- documentation_registry: Tracks project artifacts for human comprehension\n\n### EXAMPLE PROJECT: Simple Todo App ###\n**Worker Output**: @SpecWriter_Feature_Overview completes AddTask specification, provides NL summary: \"AddTask specification created with user stories, API endpoints defined, data models specified. Document saved to docs/specs/addtask.md. Ready for architecture phase.\"\n\n**Orchestrator Handoff**: @orchestrator-project-initialization synthesizes all worker summaries + own actions: \"Project initialization completed. Research planning identified technology options, feature specification defined core modules, architecture established patterns. Master plan created at docs/Master_Project_Plan.md.\"\n\n**Scribe Interpretation**: Receives comprehensive summary, analyzes using interpretationLogic, extracts entities (project completion, scaffolding needs, document paths), generates signals:\n- project_initialization_complete\n- framework_scaffolding_needed  \n- feature_specification_complete\n- architecture_definition_required\n- Updates documentation_registry with created documents\n\n### CONCLUSION ###\n@orchestrator-pheromone-scribe is the intelligent agent singularly responsible for translating narrative outcomes into formal JSON signal language, guided by .swarmConfig interpretationLogic, promoting transparency and human oversight.\n\n### SUCCESS CRITERIA ###\n‚úì Core concepts clearly explained with examples\n‚úì Information flow illustrated with Todo App scenario\n‚úì Scribe's central role emphasized\n‚úì Human oversight mechanisms highlighted",
