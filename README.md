## üåü Overview

Phero-Swarm is a sophisticated **AI agent swarm orchestration framework** based on the principles of **digital stigmergy** ‚Äî inspired by how social insects like ants coordinate through pheromone trails. This system enables autonomous software development through intelligent coordination of specialized AI agents without requiring direct agent-to-agent communication.

**Security Note**: The security of the Phero-Swarm system is paramount. All configurations must be validated against a schema before loading, and their storage and modification must be strictly controlled. Operational security measures, such as hardening execution environments and implementing robust monitoring, are critical.

### üß† Key Concepts

- **Digital Stigmergy**: Agents communicate by modifying a shared environment (`.pheromone` file) rather than direct messaging.
- **Natural Language Communication**: Agents provide human-readable summaries of their work.
- **Central State Management**: Only the Pheromone Scribe interprets and updates the shared state. The Pheromone Scribe's execution environment must be hardened and secured.
- **Human-Centric Design**: All outputs optimized for human understanding and oversight.
- **Self-Optimization**: System monitors performance and evolves agent capabilities.

#### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Worker Modes (Executors)
Specialized agents that perform specific tasks:
- `coder-test-driven`: Implements code using TDD methodology
- `tester-tdd-master`: Creates and runs tests
- `debugger-targeted`: Diagnoses and fixes issues
- `optimizer-module`: Improves performance
- `docs-writer-feature`: Creates documentation
- *And many more...*

#### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Task Orchestrators (Coordinators)
Higher-level agents that manage project phases:
- `orchestrator-project-initialization`: Sets up new projects
- `orchestrator-framework-scaffolding`: Creates boilerplate code
- `orchestrator-feature-implementation-tdd`: Manages development
- `orchestrator-refinement-and-maintenance`: Manages change requests

#### 3Ô∏è‚É£ Meta-Orchestrators (Strategic)
Highest-level agents managing the entire system:
- `traffic-controller`: Routes tasks based on pheromone signals
- `orchestrator-pheromone-scribe`: Interprets summaries and updates state. Its operational environment must be highly secure.
- `orchestrator-meta-alignment`: Ensures project alignment with goals.
- `orchestrator-collective-intelligence`: Optimizes reasoning systems.

## üß™ Pheromone System

The `.pheromone` file serves as the **collective memory and coordination medium**.
**Security Note**: The `.pheromone` file is critical system state. Its integrity must be protected through strict file system permissions (write access only for the authenticated Pheromone Scribe process) and mechanisms like checksums or digital signatures to detect tampering.

```json
{
  "signals": [
    {
      "id": "unique_signal_identifier",
      "signalType": "signal_type",
      "target": "target_entity",
      "strength": 0.8,
      "message": "Human-readable description",
      "data": {
        "entity_specific_data": "values",
        "file_paths": [],
        "status_codes": ""
      },
      "timestamp": "ISO_timestamp"
    }
  ],
  "documentation_registry": {
    /* Tracks all project documents for human reference */
  },
  "bayesian_beliefs": {
    /* Probabilistic reasoning about project state */
  },
  "temporal_patterns": {
    /* Detected sequences and workflows */
  },
  "learned_patterns": {
    /* Knowledge derived from successful sequences */
  }
}
```

## üîÑ Information Flow Process

1.  **Worker Execution**: Worker agents complete tasks and generate rich natural language summaries.
2.  **Orchestrator Synthesis**: Task orchestrators combine worker summaries into comprehensive reports.
3.  **Scribe Interpretation**: Pheromone Scribe converts narratives into structured JSON signals. This process must be robust against malformed or malicious inputs.
4.  **State Update**: Signals are stored in `.pheromone` file with appropriate lifecycle management.
5.  **Collective Intelligence**: System learns from patterns and optimizes future behavior. Inputs to this system must be validated.
6.  **Evolution Triggers**: Performance monitoring initiates agent improvements when needed. Data feeding evolution triggers must be secure and authentic.

## ‚ú® Key Innovations

### üß¨ Performance-Driven Evolution
The system can evolve and improve agent capabilities:
- Tracks performance metrics (completion times, success rates, resource usage). **Security**: These metrics must be sourced reliably and protected from tampering.
- Identifies inefficient patterns and recurring failures.
- Automatically rewrites agent instructions to improve performance. **Security**: The inputs influencing this rewriting (e.g., performance data, existing instructions) must be validated to prevent unsafe evolution.
- Uses **Proof-Carrying Prompts (PCP)** for safe evolution. PCP involves rigorous validation of inputs that guide evolution, ensuring that generated prompts are not only effective but also adhere to predefined safety constraints and do not introduce vulnerabilities. This includes checks against adversarial inputs and ensuring the semantic integrity of the evolved instructions.

### üìä Multi-Dimensional Intelligence
- **Bayesian Belief Networks**: Probabilistic reasoning about project success.
- **Temporal Pattern Detection**: Recognizes recurring sequences and workflows.
- **Stigmergic Learning**: Reinforces successful patterns over time.
- **Emergent Behavior Analysis**: Detects complex system behaviors.

### üë§ Human-Centric Design
- All outputs designed for human understanding.
- Comprehensive documentation registry.
- Natural language summaries at every level.
- Audit trails for debugging and oversight.

### üì¶ Compressed State Management
- Signals evaporate over time (fade away).
- Related signals are consolidated.
- Operational details are archived.
- Only critical information is retained.

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Project Initialization
1.  Create a blueprint file following the structure in `docs/NewProject_Alpha_Blueprint.md`. Ensure all inputs are sanitized.
2.  Initialize the project with your blueprint.
3.  The system will automatically:
    - Research and plan the project
    - Create specifications and architecture
    - Develop a framework scaffold
    - Implement features with tests
    - Document the entire system

### Configuration
Key configuration files:
- `.swarmConfig`: Core configuration
- `.swarm/detailed.config.json`: Interpretation logic
- `.swarm/performance.config.json`: Performance monitoring
- `.swarm/intelligence.config.json`: Collective intelligence
- `.swarm/coordination.config.json`: Peer coordination

**Security Note**: All JSON configuration files MUST be validated against a strict schema before being loaded by the system. Ensure these files are stored securely and changes are managed through a version control system with appropriate reviews.

## üìù Blueprint Creation

The quality of your project blueprint significantly impacts swarm performance. A good blueprint includes:

1.  **Strategic Foundation**
    - Primary goals (3-5 maximum)
    - Critical constraints
    - Technology mandates
    - Priority features

2.  **Swarm-Optimized Feature Breakdown**
    - Dependencies between features
    - Parallel work opportunities
    - Integration points
    - Success criteria

3.  **Performance and Evolution Guidance**
    - Expected agent patterns
    - Evolution triggers
    - Success metrics baselines

4.  **Human Oversight Points**
    - Required reviews
    - Quality gates
    - Escalation triggers

See `docs/NewProject_Alpha_Blueprint.md` for a detailed example. The generation of blueprints from user concepts must follow strict input sanitization and validation procedures as outlined in `docs/blueprint-generator-system-prompt.md`.
